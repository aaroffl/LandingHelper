# LandingHelper

Landing helper is a low-cost landing aid for personal aircraft. 

Though it can be used for land-based landings, it's most useful for water landings, where certain conditions can make it extremely difficult for pilots to know their altitude above the water.

LandingHelper achieves this by using a laser distance module intended for drones, connected to a raspberry pi. Distances are interpreted and relayed as voices to the pilot through their headset via Bluetooth.

Thanks to advances in drone accessories, cost-effective products like the Lightspeed X11 laser (about $300) are more readily available, and offer a very promising cost-to-performance ratio. Alternatives built specifically for personal aircraft can easily range in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.
