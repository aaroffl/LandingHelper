# LandingHelper

Landing helper is a low-cost landing aid for personal aircraft. 

Though it can be used for land-based landings, it's most useful for water landings, where certain conditions can make it extremely difficult for pilots to know their altitude above the water.

It achieves this by using a laser distance module intended for drones, connected to a raspberry pi. Distances are interpreted and relayed as voices to the pilot through their headset via Bluetooth.
